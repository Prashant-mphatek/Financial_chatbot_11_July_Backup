Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales.
It deals with physical phenomena at atomic and subatomic levels.
The theory was developed in the early 20th century.
Max Planck is considered the father of quantum theory.
He introduced the idea of energy quanta in 1900.
Albert Einstein explained the photoelectric effect using quanta in 1905.
Niels Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom in 1913.
Bohr's model introduced quantized energy levels for electrons.
Quantum mechanics replaced classical mechanics at microscopic scales.
It introduces the concept of wave-particle duality.
Electrons exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior.
Louis de Broglie proposed matter waves in 1924.
The Schrödinger equation describes how quantum states evolve over time.
Erwin Schrödinger formulated his wave equation in 1926.
Werner Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics.
Heisenberg also introduced the uncertainty principle.
The uncertainty principle limits how precisely we can know position and momentum.
Quantum superposition allows particles to be in multiple states at once.
Measurement collapses a superposition to a definite state.
The Copenhagen interpretation emphasizes the role of measurement.
Quantum entanglement links particles such that one's state affects the other.
Entanglement was famously described as 'spooky action at a distance' by Einstein.
Bell's Theorem supports the non-local nature of quantum mechanics.
Quantum tunneling allows particles to pass through barriers.
It underlies the operation of devices like tunnel diodes.
The quantum harmonic oscillator is a fundamental model.
Quantum field theory combines quantum mechanics with special relativity.
The Standard Model is a quantum field theory describing particle physics.
Fermions follow the Pauli exclusion principle.
Bosons can occupy the same quantum state.
Photons are quantum particles of light.
Quantum electrodynamics describes the interaction of light and matter.
Quantum chromodynamics explains the strong force binding quarks.
The weak nuclear force is responsible for radioactive decay.
Quantum computing uses qubits instead of classical bits.
Qubits exploit superposition and entanglement for computation.
Quantum algorithms can outperform classical ones for certain problems.
Shor’s algorithm can factor large numbers efficiently.
Quantum cryptography ensures secure communication using quantum principles.
Quantum teleportation transfers quantum states between particles.
Decoherence causes quantum systems to lose quantum behavior.
Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by operators.
 Eigenvalues of operators correspond to measurable quantities.
The Born rule connects wave functions to probabilities.
The many-worlds interpretation suggests all outcomes occur in parallel universes.
Quantum mechanics underlies modern technologies like lasers and semiconductors.
 It has implications in philosophy regarding determinism and reality.
 Experiments constantly validate quantum mechanics’ predictions.
 Despite its strangeness, quantum mechanics is immensely successful.
It remains a vibrant area of research with many open questions.
